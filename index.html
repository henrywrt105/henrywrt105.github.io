    <h2 id="CD"><strong>Course Description and Rationale</strong></h2>

    <p>
      <strong>WRT 105 is an introduction to composing and its relationship to cultures and communities,
      identities and ideologies, and technologies and media.</strong> In this class, writing is both a
      subject of inquiry and the primary activity. You will write, revise, edit and reflect with
      the support of the teacher and peers. You will also engage critically with the opinions and
      voices of others, as you develop a greater understanding of how your writing can have an
      effect on yourself and your audiences.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>The course will engage you in analysis and argument</strong>, practices that carry across
      academic disciplinary lines and into professional and civic writing. These
      interdependent practices are fundamental to the work you will do as a college
      student and in your careers and civic life.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Analysis, as Rosenwasser and Stephen claim in Writing Analytically 7th edition,</strong>
      “is a form of detective work that typically pursues something puzzling, something
      you are seeking to understand rather than something you believe you already have
      the answers to. Analysis finds questions where there seemed not to be any, and
      it makes connections that might not have been evident at first. Analysis is,
      then, more than just a set of skills: it is a frame of mind, an attitude toward
      experience” (2-3). You analyze when you talk to a friend to get another perspective
      on the US Women’s performance in the 2015 World Cup, when you read up on the recent
      negotiations with Iran over their nuclear program in order to discuss it more
      confidently in your global politics class, when you watch and re-watch a film in
      order to discern how it works on a visual level, or when you review a sampling of
      your own writing in order to see and make sense of the patterns in your work.
    </p>

    <p>
       <strong>Argument involves inquiry and analysis</strong> and engages others in ongoing conversations
       about topics of common concern. Evidence for your arguments comes from analysis,
       from discussion with others, from your personal experience, and from research.
       Arguments are also situationally specific: that is, they look, sound, and persuade
       differently depending on audience, purpose, genre and context.  In addition to
       being persuasive, arguments can be a means of sharing information, posing important
       questions, or even raising consciousness about issues.
